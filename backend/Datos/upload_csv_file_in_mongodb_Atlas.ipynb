In microgravity, osteoclast-mediated bone resorption is known, but osteocytic osteolysis and cell cycle arrest during osteogenesis may also contribute to bone loss. In this study, 16-week-old female C57BL/6J mice were exposed to microgravity for 15 days aboard the STS-131 space shuttle. µCT analysis showed a 6.29% decrease in bone volume and 11.91% reduction in bone thickness. Osteoclast-covered trabecular bone surfaces increased by 170% (p=0.004), indicating osteoclastic degradation. High-resolution nanoCT revealed signs of osteolysis, including increased lacunar area, perimeter, and canalicular diameter. MMP 1, 3, and 10 expressions increased, with MMP10 localized to osteocytes, suggesting osteocytic osteolysis. CDKN1a/p21 expression increased 3.31-fold (p<0.01) in osteoblasts, potentially inhibiting cell cycle progression. Trp53, an apoptosis inducer, was down-regulated, which may support cell survival.

It disrupts the immune system by impairing T cell activation, cytokine production, and macrophage differentiation, increasing infection susceptibility. In cancer research, microgravity promotes tumor-like spheroid formation in cancer stem cells, offering insights into tumor dynamics. It also enhances tissue regeneration by modulating pathways like Hippo and PI3K-Akt, improving stem cell differentiation into hematopoietic and cardiomyocyte lineages. At the organ level, it impacts liver metabolism, endothelial function, and bone health, leading to lipid dysregulation, vascular remodeling, and bone loss. Microgravity also boosts mitochondrial function and structural maturation in cardiomyocytes derived from human pluripotent stem cells, offering potential therapies for cardiac diseases.
