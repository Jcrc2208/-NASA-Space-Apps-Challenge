1,Mice in Bion-M 1 space mission: training and selection,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4136787/,"The Bion-M 1 mission aimed to study the effects of microgravity on physiological systems using male C57/BL6 mice. The training program and pre-flight tests were essential to select homogeneous groups. After the 30-day spaceflight, the mice showed signs of disadaptation to Earth's gravity, including impaired motor functions and behavioral changes. A significant loss of mice occurred during the flight, which was mainly attributed to a malfunction in the food distribution system. Despite the challenges, the study found that the training program was effective and that male mice could be successfully used in space biomedical research.","The study was conducted under microgravity conditions aboard the Bion-M 1 biosatellite. The mice were exposed to spaceflight for 30 days, during which the habitat conditions, including temperature, humidity, and air composition, were controlled. The flight aimed to investigate the adaptation of various physiological systems, such as muscle, bone, cardiovascular, sensorimotor, and nervous systems, to prolonged exposure in microgravity. After the flight, the mice were monitored for recovery and adjustment to Earth's gravity.","The organism used in the study was male C57/BL6 mice. These mice were specifically selected for their size and the fact that they do not undergo sex steroid cycling, which made them suitable for the experiments. They were housed in groups and trained prior to the flight to ensure they met the criteria for the study.",Alexander Andreev-Andrievskiy.,2014
2,"Microgravity induces pelvic bone loss through osteoclastic activity, osteocytic osteolysis, and osteoblastic cell cycle inhibition by CDKN1a/p21",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3630201/,"Bone is a dynamically remodeled tissue that requires gravity for maintenance. In microgravity, osteoclast-mediated bone resorption is known, but osteocytic osteolysis and cell cycle arrest during osteogenesis may also contribute to bone loss. In this study, 16-week-old female C57BL/6J mice were exposed to microgravity for 15 days aboard the STS-131 space shuttle. µCT analysis showed a 6.29% decrease in bone volume and 11.91% reduction in bone thickness. Osteoclast-covered trabecular bone surfaces increased by 170% (p=0.004), indicating osteoclastic degradation. High-resolution nanoCT revealed signs of osteolysis, including increased lacunar area, perimeter, and canalicular diameter. MMP 1, 3, and 10 expressions increased, with MMP10 localized to osteocytes, suggesting osteocytic osteolysis. CDKN1a/p21 expression increased 3.31-fold (p<0.01) in osteoblasts, potentially inhibiting cell cycle progression. Trp53, an apoptosis inducer, was down-regulated, which may support cell survival. This study highlights microgravity-induced osteocytic osteolysis and CDKN1a/p21-mediated cell cycle arrest as contributors to bone loss.",Microgravity,Mice,Elizabeth A Blaber ,2013
3,Stem Cell Health and Tissue Regeneration in Microgravity,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11988870/,"Microgravity, with its minimal gravitational forces, profoundly affects biological systems, including human cells. It disrupts the immune system by impairing T cell activation, cytokine production, and macrophage differentiation, increasing infection susceptibility. In cancer research, microgravity promotes tumor-like spheroid formation in cancer stem cells, offering insights into tumor dynamics. It also enhances tissue regeneration by modulating pathways like Hippo and PI3K-Akt, improving stem cell differentiation into hematopoietic and cardiomyocyte lineages. At the organ level, it impacts liver metabolism, endothelial function, and bone health, leading to lipid dysregulation, vascular remodeling, and bone loss. Microgravity also boosts mitochondrial function and structural maturation in cardiomyocytes derived from human pluripotent stem cells, offering potential therapies for cardiac diseases. These findings underscore the dual implications of microgravity for both space medicine and terrestrial health, highlighting its potential in regenerative medicine, oncology, and immunology.",Microgravity,Human cells ,Megan M Pendleton,2018
4,Microgravity Reduces the Differentiation and Regenerative Potential of Embryonic Stem Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7998608/,"Exposure to microgravity for 15 days inhibited differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) into various cell types, as indicated by reduced expression of lineage-specific markers. Additionally, embryoid bodies (EBs) formed in microgravity retained stem cell self-renewal markers and demonstrated increased differentiation potential upon return to Earth's gravity.",Microgravity,Mouse,Nelson López,2015
5,Microgravity validation of a novel system for RNA isolation and multiplex quantitative real time PCR analysis of gene expression on the International Space Station,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5587110/,"Spaceflight for 15 days led to altered expression of 37 out of 168 genes tested in mouse cardiac tissue. Notably, there was downregulation of the transcription factor Nfe2l2 (Nrf2) and upregulation of Nox1, indicating increased oxidative stress. Additionally, Cdkn1a (p21) and Myc, genes associated with cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, were upregulated, while the inflammatory gene Tnf was downregulated. No significant changes were observed in apoptosis-related genes like Trp53.",Microgravity,Mouse,Akhilesh Kumar ,2021
6,Spaceflight Modulates the Expression of Key Oxidative Stress and Cell Cycle Related Genes in Heart,Spaceflight Modulates the Expression of Key Oxidative Stress and Cell Cycle Related Genes in Heart,"Spaceflight alters cardiovascular gene expression, contributing to cardiac dysfunction. Mice exposed to spaceflight for 15 days showed changes in 37 out of 168 genes, including increased oxidative stress markers (Nox1), upregulated cell cycle/apoptosis genes (Cdkn1a, Myc), and downregulated anti-inflammatory genes (Tnf). No changes were observed in apoptosis-related genes like Trp53. These changes suggest spaceflight may cause cardiac dysfunction due to oxidative stress.",Microgravity,Mice,Akhilesh Kumar ,2021
7,Dose- and Ion-Dependent Effects in the Oxidative Stress Response to Space-Like Radiation Exposure in the Skeletal System,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5666799/,"Exposure to high-LET ^56Fe ions at 200 cGy caused significant bone loss and inhibited osteoblastogenesis by over 90% in mice, while low doses (5–50 cGy) had no significant effects. High-LET irradiation also increased expression of redox-related genes like Catalase and Gadd45.",Exposure to high-LET ^56Fe ions and low-LET protons,Mice,Joshua Alwood,2017
8,From the bench to exploration medicine: NASA life sciences translational research for human exploration and habitation missions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5460236/,"NASA’s Space Biology and Human Research Program entities have recently spearheaded communications both internally and externally to coordinate the agency’s translational research efforts. In this paper, we strongly advocate for translational research at NASA, provide recent examples of NASA sponsored early-stage translational research, and discuss options for a path forward. Our overall objective is to help in stimulating a collaborative research across multiple disciplines and entities that, working together, will more effectively and more rapidly achieve NASA’s goals for human spaceflight.",Translational research,Human,Joshua S Alwood,2017
9,High-precision method for cyclic loading of small-animal vertebrae to assess bone quality.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6222041/,"The experiment was conducted under microgravity conditions during a 15-day mission aboard the STS-131 space shuttle. The subjects were 16-week-old female C57BL/6J mice, with a sample size of eight. The pelvic region of the mice was analyzed using µCT (micro-computed tomography) and high-resolution X-ray nanoCT to evaluate bone volume, thickness, and signs of osteolysis. Osteoclast-mediated bone resorption was measured by assessing TRAP-positive osteoclast-covered trabecular bone surfaces. Additionally, gene expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and CDKN1a/p21, as well as apoptosis markers, was measured using RT-qPCR. The study aimed to investigate the effects of microgravity on bone loss, focusing on osteoclastic degradation, osteocytic osteolysis, and cell cycle arrest during osteogenesis.",Cyclic loading,Mice,Megan M Pendleton,2018
